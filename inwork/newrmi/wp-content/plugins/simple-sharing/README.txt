== Description ==
Tired of sharing plugins that route all your shares through their site, or weigh your site down with massive bloatware?

We were, so we made this simple sharing plugin that just adds a few links for your visitors to share posts and pages directly to the selected social media hassle-free.

By using our shortcode `[ESSharer]` you can add the sharing tool to any page you want, in addition to the one you can find at the bottom of each page and post with content.

We do offer a Premium version with configuration settings that enable you to configure the sharing tool a bit more.
